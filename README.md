REPULS.IO is a game Developed by @developer-docski. This is just a native client created by me so that you can use the tiny benefits of a client before it's release. Currently the Client supports Windows only. You can create your own MacOS or Linux Package, it's not that hard.
What this Client does:
- Boosts fps a bit more than your normal browser
- Uses your CPU and GPU for rendering
- Adds different Flags on top of the game so that it's smoother
- Allows almost any size of monitor to run the game
- Uses chromium browser for maximum efficiency
- Uses personal UserAgent to optimize as per browser

Some extra features that it has:
- Opens links outside of tab and in your browser
- Built in shortcuts(mentioned below)
- Delayed opening and Disabled frame rate limit
- Supports higher DPI than normal browser
- Has Discord RPC for all users
  
Commands:
- Ctrl+F5: Reload with cache removal
- F9: devtools
- F11: Fullscreen
- F7: Beta website

Currently the client DOES NOT support google login because only the developer(docski) can do that. Everything else works fine and smoother.

You can check the files with an antivirus first if you like, there's not much code in there anyway.

Contact me if you want to install this on MacOS/Linux, discord: aman_and_cats.

Inspired by Nexide's Nexi Client.
