REPULS.IO is a game developed by @developer-docski. This is just a native client made by me so that you can use the tiny benefits of a client before its release. Currently supports Windows. 

V1.10.0 Changes:
- Cut background consumption and power-saving mode automated
- BrowserWindow Configuration optimized
- Asset caching for Preloading
- GPU rasterization disabled automatically for weak GPUs
- Shortcut leak fixed
- Clean shutdown and restart(when you close the game it clears unnecessary cache on it's own so that the game starts fresh next time, this does not log you out of your account.)
- Telemetry and update checks permanently removed(we don't really need it for the game lol)
- Discord RPC launches after game starts(delay) so that discord recognizes it easier

What this client does:
- Boosts FPS a bit more than your browser.
- Uses your CPU and GPU for rendering.
- Implements different flags client sided to increase performance.
- Allows almost any size of monitor to run the game.
- Uses Chromium browser for maximum efficiency.
- Uses personal UserAgent to optimize as per browser.

Some extra features:
- Opens links in your default browser.
- Built-in shortcuts (mentioned below).
- Delayed opening and disabled frame rate limit.
- Supports higher DPI than normal browser.
- Includes Discord RPC.
  
Commands:
- Ctrl + F5: Reload with cache removal
- F9: DevTools
- F11: Fullscreen
- F7: Beta website

Currently the client DOES NOT support Google login. Everything else works fine and smooth.

You can check the files with an antivirus first if you like, there's not a lot in here anyway.

Contact me if you want to install this on MacOS/Linux, Discord: aman_and_cats.
