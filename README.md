REPULS.IO is a game developed by [@developer-docski](https://github.com/tahirG?tab=sponsoring). This is just a native client made by me so that you can use the tiny benefits of a client before its release. Currently supports Windows(V1.20.0 Released)

What this client does:
- Boosts FPS a bit more than your browser.
- Uses your CPU and GPU for rendering.
- Implements different flags client sided to increase performance.
- Allows almost any size of monitor to run the game.
- Uses Chromium browser for maximum efficiency.
- Uses personal UserAgent to optimize as per browser.

Some extra features:
- Opens links in your default browser.
- Built-in shortcuts (mentioned below).
- Delayed opening and disabled frame rate limit.
- Supports higher DPI than normal browser.
- Includes Discord RPC.
  
Commands:
- Ctrl +F1: Reload client with Full reset
- Ctrl + F5: Reload with cache removal
- F9: DevTools
- F11: Fullscreen
- F7: Beta website

Google Support added in Version 1.20.5

You can check the files with an antivirus first if you like, there's not a lot in here anyway.
